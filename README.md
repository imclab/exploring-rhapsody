## 1. About Rhapsody

Rhapsody is a UML-based formal modeling environment that can be used
to simulate and test the behavior of real-time and embedded systems.
You can use Rhapsody to build UML class diagram and statechart as usual,
and then attach actual implementation to the operations in your diagram
and watch Rhapsody step through the states according to the behavior
you've defined. This will help you visualize your program's flow
and help you catch potential design flaws and edge cases you might not
have covered.
